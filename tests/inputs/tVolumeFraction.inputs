#==============================================================================
# Input file for tVolumeFraction test
#
# Tests the VolumeFraction class by reading a TIFF file, thresholding it,
# calculating volume fractions, and comparing against optional expected values
# or direct summation. Includes options for diagnostic output.
#==============================================================================

# Path to the input image file used to define the geometry/phases.
# Ensure this is the correct 1-bit TIFF file being investigated.
tifffile = data/SampleData_2Phase_stack_3d_1bit.tif

# --- Phase Definition Parameters ---

# Integer ID assigned to voxels with raw values <= threshold
phase0_id = 0

# Integer ID assigned to voxels with raw values > threshold
phase1_id = 1

# Component index within the iMultiFab where phase data is stored
comp = 0

# Threshold value applied to the raw data read from the TIFF file
threshold = 0.5

# --- AMReX Grid Setup ---

# Maximum grid size used when creating the BoxArray for the iMultiFab
box_size = 32

# --- Test Behavior Controls ---

# Verbosity level:
# 0: Minimal output (Pass/Fail only)
# 1: Standard test progress and results output
# 2: More detailed internal steps
# 3+: Enable detailed TiffReader boundary debugging output (if compiled in)
verbose = 1 # Set high to enable boundary debug prints from TiffReader

# Enable/disable the check that prints boundary corner values after thresholding
# Options: true / false / 1 / 0
check_boundary_voxels = true

# Tolerance used when comparing calculated vs expected volume fractions (if provided)
# Also used for comparing VolumeFraction class against direct summation.
tolerance = 1e-9

# --- Optional Verification Values ---
# Set expected values if you want the test to PASS/FAIL based on them.
# Use negative values (e.g., -1.0) to skip the check against these specific numbers.
# Currently set to skip, as the focus is on observing the calculated values.
expected_vf0 = -1.0  # Expected volume fraction for phase 0 (e.g., 0.617725 if checking against current C++ result)
expected_vf1 = -1.0  # Expected volume fraction for phase 1 (e.g., 0.382275)

# Note: Parameters like 'direction', 'solver', 'hypre.*', 'tortuosity.*' are
#       not used by this specific test program (tVolumeFraction).
