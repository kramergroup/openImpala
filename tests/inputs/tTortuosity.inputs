# Input file for tTortuosity test

# Path to the input image file used to define the geometry/phases.

# --- Tortuosity specific parameters ---

# Set these explicitly based on your test case needs.
# Examples:
# phase_id = 1             # ID of the phase to calculate tortuosity for (MUST BE SET if not default in C++)
# direction = 0            # 0=X, 1=Y, 2=Z (MUST BE SET if not default in C++)
# solver_type = GMRES      # Solver type (e.g., GMRES, PCG, FlexGMRES, Jacobi)

# --- Solver Controls (Crucial for Debugging/Testing) ---
# Reduce iterations and loosen tolerance to check for hangs/slowness quickly.
# Increase maxiter and tighten eps for production runs or accuracy tests.
hypre.maxiter = 50      # Max solver iterations (Reduced for faster testing/debugging hangs)
hypre.eps = 1e-6        # Solver relative tolerance (Loosened for faster testing)

# --- Test Verbosity ---
# Increase verbosity for more detailed output during test run.
# Assumes TortuosityHypre class checks this value.
verbose = 2

# Optional output file (usually not needed for automated tests)
# output_file = tort.txt

# Expected values for verification (Optional - set if known for the sample data)
# expected_vf = 0.5
# expected_tau = 2.0
# tolerance = 1e-6      # Tolerance for comparing expected vs actual values
