# ============================================================
# Inputs for Diffusion.cpp Tortuosity Calculation
# Refactored based on review.
# Oxford, UK - Tue Mar 25 2025 10:26 PM GMT
# ============================================================

# --- Input File Configuration ---

# Input filename (TIFF, DAT, RAW, HDF5). Mandatory.
filename = "data/SampleData_2Phase.tif"

# Path prefix for the input file (optional, '.' means relative to executable location)
data_path = "."

# --- Reader Specific Parameters (Uncomment and set as needed) ---

# Required for HDF5: Path to dataset within HDF5 file
# hdf5_dataset = "exchange/data"

# Required if reading a sequence of TIFFs instead of multi-directory TIFF
# tiff_stack_size = 100

# Required if reading RAW or DAT files (Reader needs dimensions & type)
# raw_width     = 100
# raw_height    = 100
# raw_depth     = 100
# raw_datatype  = "UINT8" # e.g., UINT8, UINT16_LE, FLOAT32_BE etc. (See RawReader.H)

# --- Analysis Parameters ---

# Phase ID within the (potentially thresholded) input data to analyze
# Usually 0 or 1 for binary data resulting from thresholding.
phase_id = 1

# Threshold value used by readers (TiffReader, DatReader, HDF5Reader)
# Adjust based on input data type/range (e.g., 127.5 for uint8 0-255)
threshold_value = 1.0 # Example: check if appropriate for SampleData_2Phase.tif

# Direction(s) for tortuosity calculation
# Options: "X", "Y", "Z", "All", or space-separated list like "X Z"
direction = "All"

# --- Solver Configuration (for TortuosityHypre) ---

# Solver type: Jacobi, GMRES, FlexGMRES, PCG (Case-insensitive likely)
solver_type = "FlexGMRES"

# Relative tolerance for the HYPRE solver convergence
hypre_eps = 1e-9

# Maximum iterations for the HYPRE solver
hypre_maxiter = 200

# --- Grid Configuration ---

# AMReX maximum grid size (1D) - affects parallel decomposition efficiency
box_size = 32

# --- Output Configuration ---

# Directory for results (output file, optional plotfiles).
# '~/' at the beginning will be expanded to the user's $HOME directory.
results_dir = "~/openimpala_results/" # Ensure trailing slash if desired

# Name for the output text file containing summary results
output_filename = "diffusion_results.txt"

# Flag to enable writing detailed plotfiles from solver (0=No, 1=Yes)
write_plotfile = 0

# --- Comparison/Test Parameters (Optional) ---

# Tolerance for comparing calculated vs expected floating-point results (if provided)
tolerance = 1e-9

# Expected Volume Fraction (optional, for testing) - uncomment and set value if needed
# expected_vf = 0.5123

# Expected Tortuosity (optional, for testing) - uncomment and set value if needed
# expected_tau = 1.956

# --- Control ---

# Verbosity level (0=minimal, 1=standard, >1 for more debug output)
verbose = 1
